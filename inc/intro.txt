    This tool grabs the user's name, PC name, Windows version, and a list of 
    any Microsoft software (with version numbers) and plops it in a .csv file.
    
    ONLY WORKS WITH WINDOWS VISTA / WINDOWS SERVER 2008 AND UP 
    
    If an audit CSV for this computer (or one with the same name) has already 
    been created, running the tool again will overwrite it. You can find all
    the audit CSV files in the "results" folder.


    Press any key to start the audit...
