<h1>Magical Audit Tool</h1>
<h3>(or <b>"MAT"</b> for short)</h3>

A script for basic Windows license audits.

This script is for Windows PCs or server running Windows Vista / Server 2008 and up. It pulls basic information using WMI, as and lists Microsoft software installed into a CSV file.

**What info is gathered?**:

- Active User
- PC Name
- Windows Version
- List of all "Windows" software & version number

**Usage**:

1. Copy the file to the PC or to writeable removable media (USB drive, etc).
2. Log in as the primary user of the PC (if the auditor requires this information)
3. Right-click MAT.bat and run as administrator.
4. The CSV will be created in the same directory as MAT.bat. If this file already exists, it will be overwritten.

See the example file for the output format.
